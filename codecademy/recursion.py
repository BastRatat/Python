#Recursion has two fundamental aspects: the base case and the recursive step.
#The base case dictates whether the function will recurse, or call itself. Without a base case, it’s the iterative equivalent to writing an infinite loop.

#Because we’re using a call stack to track the function calls, your computer will throw an error due to a stack overflow if the base case is not sufficient.

#The other fundamental aspect of a recursive function is the recursive step. This portion of the function is the step that moves us closer to the base case.

#In a recursive function, the “counting variable” equivalent is the argument to the recursive call.

#Analyzing the Big O runtime of a recursive function is very similar to analyzing an iterative function. Substitute iterations of a loop with recursive calls.
