#A stack is a data structure which contains an ordered set of data.

#Stacks provide three methods for interaction:

#Push - adds data to the “top” of the stack
#Pop - returns and removes data from the “top” of the stack
#Peek - returns data from the “top” of the stack without removing it

#This is a Last In, First Out or LIFO structure.

# Depending on the implementation, the top of the stack is equivalent to the head node of a linked list and the bottom of the stack is equivalent to the tail node.

#A constraint that may be placed on a stack is its size. This is done to limit and quantify the resources the data structure will take up when it is “full”.

#Attempting to push data onto an already full stack will result in a stack overflow. 

# SUM UP

#Stacks:

#Contain data nodes
#Support three main operations
#Push adds data to the top of the stack
#Pop removes and provides data from the top of the stack
#Peek reveals data on the top of the stack
#Implementations include a linked list or array
#Can have a limited size
#Pushing data onto a full stack results in a stack overflow
#Stacks process data Last In, First Out (LIFO)
